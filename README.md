# LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
This program is a Library Management System that manages books, members, and borrowing using hash tables, linked lists, and queues. It handles issuing and returning books, calculates due dates and fines, and auto-assigns books to waitlisted members. A menu-driven interface allows easy management of books, members, and transaction reports.
